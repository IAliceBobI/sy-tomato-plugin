## Capture Fleeting Thoughts
<details>
  
  Collect fleeting thoughts into the daily note, supporting image insertion from `camera` and `gallery`.
  
  ### Button Descriptions
  
  | üì∏ Camera | üñºÔ∏è Gallery |
  |---|---|
  | üì© Insert into daily note | üóëÔ∏è Clear list, clear input box |
  | üîÑ Sync data to cloud | |
  
  ### Using on Mobile
  
  *The original intent of the `Capture Fleeting Thoughts` feature is to quickly insert inspirations on mobile devices.*
  
  <img src="assets/idea1.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
  <img src="assets/idea2.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
  
  > [Unable to open images? Check here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-tomato-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ### Possible Categories of Recorded Information
  
  | Location: üèûÔ∏è: Paragraph Block | Health: üí™: Paragraph Block | Social: üí¨: Paragraph Block |
  |---|---|---|
  | Life: üç¥: Paragraph Block | Study: üìö: Paragraph Block | Work: üíº: Paragraph Block |
  | Task: üìå: **Task Block** | | |
  
  ### `Avoid Cloud Sync Conflicts` Option
  
  *Default is off, needs to be enabled in the settings.*
  
  <img src="assets/ideaconflict.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  Reason: Simultaneous writing to Dailynote from both desktop and mobile can cause content inconsistency, leading to conflicts during synchronization.
  
  Therefore, simultaneous modification of the same file by both ends should be avoided.
  
  When this option is enabled, the mobile end will not directly write to the daily note but will write to a sub-file of the daily note.
  
  The desktop end merges the sub-file into the daily note indirectly.
  
  The mobile end is more inclined to record and does not directly modify the daily note.
  
  The desktop end is for organizing and maintaining, and can directly modify the daily note.
  
  > Advantage: No sync conflicts.
  
  > Advantage: Mobile and desktop synchronization via cloud features without needing to enable server. For example: Settings -> Cloud -> S3 -> aliyun OSS.
  
  > Disadvantage: Newly inserted fleeting thoughts cannot be directly seen in the mobile daily note, and need to be merged by the desktop end.
  
  ### Can be used in conjunction with the `Text to Reference` feature introduced below. Quick insertion of references.
  
  <img src="assets/fastref.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  > [Unable to open images? Check here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-tomato-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ### Using on Desktop
  
  *While watching a <small>big</small> movie, you can also quickly `ctrl+Q` to open a small window and record inspirations.*
  
  If it doesn't work, check if there is a **conflict** with the `shortcut keys`.
  
  <img src="assets/ideadesktop.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  `ctrl+q` can be called from outside the application.
  `escape` to close.
  `shift+enter` for soft line breaks.
  `enter` to write into the daily note of the day.

## Text to Reference Conversion
<details>
  
  <img src="assets/text2ref.gif" alt="drawing" width="600" />
  
  ### `@@`: Exact Conversion:
  
  For example, in a content block, `aaa @@bb ccc` will be converted to `aaa bb ccc` where `bb` is a reference.
  
  Use `@` to isolate references from other text. For instance, `EE@@ABC@FF` will be converted to `EEABCFF` where `ABC` is a reference.
  
  ### `@@@`: Fuzzy Conversion:
  
  For example, in a content block, `aaa @@@Ââë‰ªô ccc` may be converted to `aaa ‰πù‰ΩçÂâë‰ªô ccc` if there is already a file named `‰πù‰ΩçÂâë‰ªô`.
  
  If there is no existing file name containing `Ââë‰ªô`, the text `@@@Ââë‰ªô` will be converted to `@Ââë‰ªô@`.
  
  **When creating a file, you can make a flashcard for it and add a pinyin attribute to the file. This needs to be enabled in the configuration.**
</details>

---

## Flashcard Priority
<details>
  
  <img src="assets/cardpri1.gif" alt="drawing" width="600" />
  
  Set priority for flashcards, with higher numerical priority being reviewed first.
  
  Within the same priority level, the order is shuffled each time for review.
  
  After setting, you can review directly using `alt+0`.
  
  The plugin sorts flashcards based on priority before review.
  
  The priority is stored in the flashcard's custom attribute `card-priority`.
  
  You can adjust it manually or through the buttons below the flashcard.
  
  The priority range is 0 to 100, with a default priority of 50. Flashcards without a set priority also default to 50.
  
  **Postponement:**
  
  Postponed flashcards are added to bookmarks for easy viewing of all postponed flashcards.
  
  After postponing a flashcard, the due date is displayed. When the time comes, it automatically returns to normal status.
  
  Postponed flashcards will not be sent to the user for review.
  
  You can also hover over the priority to view the number of review times.

## Add/Delete Flashcard Buttons During Review
<details>
  
  Please enable the `Flashcard Tools` in the configuration.
  
  **Review Interface Shortcuts:**
  
  Cancel card making: `ctrl+9`
  Skip card: `ctrl+8`
  Change priority: `ctrl+;`
  
  <img src="assets/delCard.gif" alt="drawing" width="700"/>
  
  **List Card Making:**
  
  `ctrl+1` to create a list and make a card. In a list card, using `ctrl+1` again cancels card making.
  
  <img src="assets/createCard.gif" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

## Bottom Backlinks
<details>
  
  Incorporate a bottom backlinks area similar to that in `logseq`. For list/outline blocks, we can see their parent and child blocks. The parent is viewed from the breadcrumb, and the child from the content.
  
  ### Concept Bar/Reference Bar
  
  **`Hierarchical Concept`: File names like `AA|BB|CC`, its bottom backlinks, the top double-link bar, might show: `AA*  AA|BB*  AA|BB|CC*` if available. (Red circle in the image)**
  
  **`Related Concepts`: Other double-links in the double-link bar besides `Hierarchical Concept`.**
  
  *Below demonstrates the `Hierarchical Concept Forest` with the `Text to Reference` feature enabled.*
  
  <img src="assets/bkAndText2ref.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  **Backlinks Area Tools: Edit, drag, copy with one click, move with one click, real-time search filtering, mark whether a backlink belongs to the current document, etc...**
  
  <img src="assets/bottomBK.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
  
  > Right-click menu in the document allows enabling and disabling the bottom backlinks for this document.
  
  > [If images cannot be opened, please check here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-tomato-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ### Place Unrelated Content at the Bottom
  
  <img src="assets/uncorrelated.gif" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
  
  ### Bottom Backlinks::Search Syntax
  
  *The input box supports real-time search for multiple `keywords`.*
  
  **Separate `keywords` with `spaces`, and if a `keyword` is preceded by an `exclamation mark`, it means the backlink should not contain this `keyword`.**
  
  **For example:** `Xiaoming Xiaohong !Laowang !Wangzong` will search for backlinks containing `Xiaoming` and `Xiaohong` but not containing `Laowang` or `Wangzong`.
  
  **If `keywords` are separated by `|`, it means any of these `keywords` should appear.**
  
  **For example:** `Xiaoming Xiaohong|Ruhua !Laowang !Wangzong` will search for backlinks containing `Xiaoming` and at least one of `Xiaohong` or `Ruhua`, but not containing `Laowang` or `Wangzong`.
  
  **For example:** `Xiaoming Laopao Xiaohong|Ruhua|Qiuju !Laowang !Wangzong` will search for backlinks containing `Xiaoming` and `Laopao`, and at least one of `Xiaohong`, `Ruhua`, or `Qiuju`, but not containing `Laowang` or `Wangzong`.
  
  > The `Bottom Backlinks Area` is default off, please turn it on from the configuration.

## Bidirectional Links
<details>
  
  ### Usage 1
  
  <img src="assets/bilink1.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  Use `Alt+F1` to select the first block, and use `Alt+F2` at the second block to create two links that jump to each other.
  
  `alt+shift+F1` can fix bidirectional links. For example, if you cut and paste content and the block ID changes, you can use `alt+shift+F1` to repair it.

  <img src="assets/fixbrokenlnks.gif" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

  ### Usage 2

  link to bottom: `Alt+F3`

  <img src="assets/bilink1bottom.gif" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

  ### Usage 3
  
  <img src="assets/bilink2.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  Shortcut: `Alt+/` or select the corresponding function from the menu.
  
  > **Tip** Multiple lines can be selected, but the shortcut key: `Alt+/` must be used.

## Reading Point
<details>
  
  <img src="assets/readingpoint.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  *A reading point is the last position read in a document, which is recorded in the `bookmark` and automatically deletes other `bookmarks` within the current file to maintain only one `bookmark` in the file.*
  
  **Place the cursor on the `content block` to be selected, use the right-click menu, or directly use `Ctrl+2`.**
  
  **To view the `bookmark` later, you can directly check the `bookmarks panel`. You can also click the `Reading Point` (ctrl+4) icon in the upper right corner to view more detailed information.**
  
  <img src="assets/bookmark.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  > The Reading Point has been upgraded: In addition to the previous bookmark function, flashcards have been added, utilizing the scheduling capabilities of flashcards, and also saving which files have been viewed at the time.
  
  > **Note** The grouping method of the `Reading Point` icon is different from that of the bookmarks panel.

## Cleaning Invalid Flashcards
<details>
  
  <img src="assets/cleancards.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  *If the content where the flashcards are located has been deleted, these invalid flashcards still exist on the disk. We can delete them.*
  
  **Open the command palette and select `Clean All Invalid Flashcards`**
  
  > **Note** Do not use this feature while the index is being rebuilt. The index being rebuilt is not yet complete, and the plugin may be misled by the index, leading to accidental deletion of flashcards.
  
  > **Note** If you use this feature after closing the `notebook`, normal flashcards may also be considered invalid. Therefore, all notebooks should be open when using this feature.
  
  > **Note** Make a backup before using!

## Handling Long Content Operations
<details>
  
  *Copying, moving, and deleting long content drives me crazy! Here, I use a simple method to handle such operations!*
  
  **Moving Operation**
  
  <img src="assets/longMove.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  *Suppose there are `Document 1` and `Document 2`, in `Document 1`, wrap the content to be moved with `aacc1` and `aacc2`, then insert `aacc3` at a certain position in `Document 2`, and finally open the `command palette` and select `Batch Move Large Continuous Content`*
  
  **This moving operation will transfer the flashcards along with the content, without changing the review status of the flashcards. Simple `ctrl+c,v` will make the involved flashcards invalid.**
  
  > **Note** `aacc1`, `aacc2`, `aacc3` must not have spaces before or after, otherwise the plugin will not find them.
  
  <img src="assets/cmd.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  **Copying Operation**
  
  <img src="assets/longCopy.gif" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  **Deleting Operation**
  
  Similar to the moving operation, but select the delete command and do not need to write `aacc3`.
</details>

## Image Overlay (Flashcard Image Censoring)
<details>
  
  <img src="assets/overlay.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  **Usage:** Right-click on the image block -> Plugin -> Add Image Overlay.
  
  This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the `Tomato Toolbox` configuration.
  
  **To view the original image, double-click on the area without the overlay in the image.**
  
  **Supports image zooming. Overlays created in older versions need to be re-edited to support zooming.**
  
  **Supports mouse drag to draw a rectangle.**
  
  > Why this feature?
  >
  > My needs are slightly different from the `Image Overlay` feature of [siyuan-plugin-flash-enhance](https://github.com/zxhd863943427/siyuan-plugin-flash-enhance). I want the image to always be covered, regardless of whether it is in flashcard review, unless the mouse hovers over it, the overlay will be removed. For an image with multiple overlays, only the overlay under the mouse will disappear. (Some code referenced from: [siyuan-plugin-flash-enhance](https://github.com/zxhd863943427/siyuan-plugin-flash-enhance), thanks to: [zxhd863943427](https://github.com/zxhd863943427))
